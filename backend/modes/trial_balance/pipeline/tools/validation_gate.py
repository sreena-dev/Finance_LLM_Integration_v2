"""The Validation Gate -- the safety-critical, net-new piece of this engine.

Applies to EVERY row that reaches provisional MAPPED status, from any
source (Step 2 direct resolution or Step 3/Step 4 LLM output) -- no
exceptions. This is the sole place in the whole engine that can produce
mapped_status="MAPPED": NormalizedRow is only ever constructed here (via
NormalizedRow.from_tb_row), never in normalize.py, classification.py, or
staged_narrowing.py directly. This is the direct fix for the known gap in
the old ingest_tb_to_live, where a template-path row could reach a live
table with an internal "matched but never validated" status because that
code path never called the shared taxonomy-snap+fallback machinery other
paths did -- here there is no second code path that can construct a
NormalizedRow at all.

Terminal failure here always produces UNMATCHED, never UNMAPPED -- every
row reaching this gate came from direct_rows or llm_provisional in
normalize.py, both of which require a grouping hint to have existed
(UNMAPPED is reserved for normalize.py's no_match_rows, which never reach
this gate at all).

Ported from TB_normalization_v1's core/validation_gate.py.
